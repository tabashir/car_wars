# Car Wars Movement Calculator

This is for Jackson Games 'Car Wars' and 'Dueltrack'. It tells you phase by phase which cars move and keeps track of handling class.

I originally wrote this in BBC BASIC on an Acorn Electron in the mid 1980s then converted it to QBASIC, I guess around 1993. Unfortunately the BBC BASIC version has long gone. I thought this had too, until my friend who I'd given a copy of a long while back said he still had it so I'm now putting it here so it hopefully doesn't get lost again.
